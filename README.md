## Explanation for code files

global confirmed and policy.ipynb shows the changes of the numbers of the countries which firstly introduces relevant policies.

reactionTime.ipynb shows the time for different countries to take to introduce different policies.

policyCountries.ipynb shows how the numbers of the countries taking C type and H type policies change.

convexCluster.r shows the convex cluster algorithm applying on the data of the number of days of taking C type and H type policies.

clusterCluster.ipynb shows the result of convexCluster.r by plotting scatter diagrams.

generateTimeSeries.ipynb, policyInfo.ipynb and anova.ipynb studies the different effects of the polices on controling the epidemic.

generateTimeSeries_GDP.ipynb, policyInfo_GDP.ipynb and anova_GDP.ipynb studies the different effects of the influences on the economy.
